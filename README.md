Uni Call is an open source project and an [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflow providing the fastest way to make whatever audio, video phone call or send whatever text message on your Mac OS X (ambitious :). It views your Apple Contacts (we love Apple address book and iCloud :) as the central place for all your contact information, and makes use of those information to help you initiate your phone calls or text messages as quickly as possible.

Please visit Uni Call's official project site ([http://unicall.guiguan.net](http://unicall.guiguan.net)) for more details.
